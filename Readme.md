# Readme

This project is completely unsupported. Pretty much this is a proof of concept, that you can tear apart, hack, and try to adapt into your own projects.

Long time ago I had that "amazing idea" of making a particle/transparent object shader that can be affected by lights and shadows. I made some progress, BUT
I've run into two problems:

* There was no way to make it work in cross-platform fashion (OpenGL, metal, etc)
* There was no way to make it properly work with directional lights without rewriting half of lihting system.

So, I kinda gave up on it.

Eventually, however, I realized that it ain't a good thing that this project is collecting digital dust on my hdd, so I made somewhat usable solution, and uploaded it.

Enjoy.
